# RotationVectorCapture

An application to capture rotation data from a single Android device. Currently only tested on API level 23 on a HTC M9. The data should in theory be saved to the SD card on the phone in the DCIM folder. Add it to https://github.com/Almightyquad/Motion_Capture and you can see the rotation of the phone as a 3D object.
